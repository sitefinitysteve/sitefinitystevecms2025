{"title":"Macbook stuck keys or laggy mouse","needsFixing":false,"content":"My setup:  \n  \nCinema Display-\u003eCinema Display-\u003eMacbook Pro (I believe 2015 or 2016)  \n  \nWith the middle display being where I plug in all of my USB devices.  So a Razor keyboard, mouse, and charging cable for headphones.  These all go through the cineima display and are fed into the macbook through the displayport cable.  \n  \nSo for years I\u0027ve been plagued by a problem where my keyboard (regardless of which model) would have like sticky keys, like I press **\"s\"** once, but on the screen it\u0027ll be **ssssssssssssssssssssssssssss** until I mash something else, very frustrating!  \n  \nAdditionally when moving the mouse, often in times of GPU use like youtube, twitter video, hell even slack, the mouse would just pause for a second then continue on.  \n  \nSufficed to say it made work near impossible, couldn\u0027t find any fixes online.  \n  \nHere\u0027s what the fix is:  \n**BUY A _POWERED_ USB HUB, plug devices into that, then the hub into the macbook**  \n  \nTurns out the hyper expensive cinema display can\u0027t seem to properly feed the macbook, maybe firmware, or just not enough bandwidth, but I haven\u0027t had even a single stutter in 3 weeks.","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img7.jpg","seoDescription":"My fix for a macbook pro with sticky keys and a laggy mouse.","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img7.jpg","publishedAt":"2018-09-19T16:18:09.4530000Z","slug":"macbook-stuck-keys-or-laggy-mouse","legacyUrl":"/code/2018/09/19/macbook-stuck-keys-or-laggy-mouse","markdown":true,"tags":["Rants"]}
