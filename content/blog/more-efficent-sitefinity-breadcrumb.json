{"title":"More Efficent Sitefinity Breadcrumb","needsFixing":false,"content":"The Sitefinity breadcrumb widget works well, however it\u0027s got a couple things you might want to fix...  \n  \n1) It sends down a RadSiteMap stylesheet...the whole thing I\u0027m estimating about 4k, probably a bit less with Gzip...regardless, it\u0027s larger than you need.  Most designers call for their own style anyway, so just wipe and start from scratch.  \n  \n2) This is a bug with most simpleview based controls.  Without the Render function modified they\u0027re wrapped in empty elements.  In this case an empty div wraps the entire control (no class or anything to get a handle on it).  \n  \nSo just create a new class somewhere in your project, paste this in (adjust the namespace), then in settings use it over the base breadcrumb.  \n  \nIt\u0027ll be a MARGINAL amount of work to style it, but saves bytes :)  \n  \n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/abcd7e609d18f0dd6be3e1b5644dd44e.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n  \n@Telerik, please feel free to make these core :)  \n  \nCheers,  \nSteve","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img4.jpg","seoDescription":"Modify the Sitefinity Breadcrumb control to be more lean and efficient.","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img4.jpg","publishedAt":"2012-11-26T04:57:00.5930000Z","slug":"more-efficent-sitefinity-breadcrumb","legacyUrl":"/code/2012/11/26/more-efficent-sitefinity-breadcrumb","markdown":true,"tags":["Tutorial"]}
