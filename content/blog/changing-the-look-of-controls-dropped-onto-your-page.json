The first repeater is the one we want to deal, with as that\u0027s what\u0027s going to be displaying the blog entries.\n\n  You can see where it\u0027s inserting the Generic Blog content inside the **pnlPostContent** Panel control.  I normally leave this alone and go about moving the other items below it around.  However you should be careful of deleting some of the controls, I think the backend trys to reference the ID of a control on the page which doesn\u0027t exist.  To be safe, just set their visibility or display to false or none respectivly.\n\n_**...time passes as we modify the flow of the data...**_\n\n*   Ok, now in page edit mode, edit the BlogPosts control you\u0027ve dropped onto your page\n*   Click the Advanced Tab\n*   Locate the Appearance Section and expand it\n*   You want to look for the items that end with \"TemplatePath\"\n*   Click the selector beside it and find the template file you\u0027ve uploaded.  I would highly recommend not putting it under the Sitefinity root folder to avoid confusion dring upgrades\n*   Save-up, Publish, and then spend the next few minutes tweaking the css\n",
