{"title":"Easy Css Setup for Tablet and Phone NativeScript ","needsFixing":false,"content":"I recently had to modify my app to support tablets so I thought I\u0027d share a super easy way I found to add custom styling.  So I mean the app works on tablet but the UI is just stretched, not really optimizing the space.  \n  \nSo lets assume this setup (omitting JS since it doesn\u0027t apply)  \n\n* main.xml  \n* main.css  \n  \nSo lets add our custom tablet layout.  Just copy\\\\paste main.xml and rename to:  \n\n* main.minWH600.xml  \n  \nSo NativeScript is smart enough to know which XML file to load based on the naming convention... all the other files (JS\\\\CSS) load as normal; so we\u0027re still loading main.css.  \n  \nIf you create a new file named main.minWH600.css then like the XML it\u0027d load that one.  The problem I\u0027ve found is there\u0027s a lot of shared styling between the two so I don\u0027t love having an entirely separate file.  \n  \nSo here\u0027s the solution I came up with...  \nOpen your main.minWH600.xml file and on the root node, add\\\\append a class name like .tablet  \n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/cf8522bb48eeeff958524a9f2e2f70d5.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n  \n  \nSo now in your CSS you can target with a heavier selector, no need to have multiple files!\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/5b054da60dcb50f02a94b9d87c48b6a8.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img18.jpg","seoDescription":"Good way to add size specific selectors to your nativescript css","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img18.jpg","publishedAt":"2016-07-12T23:11:14.4400000Z","slug":"easy-css-setup-for-tablet-and-phone-nativescript","legacyUrl":"/code/2016/07/12/easy-css-setup-for-tablet-and-phone-nativescript","markdown":true,"tags":["Tutorial"]}
