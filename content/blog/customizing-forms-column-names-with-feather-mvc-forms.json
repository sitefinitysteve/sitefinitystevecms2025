Edit form control\n2.  Click advanced\n3.  Click Model (button)\n4.  Click MetaField (button)\n5.  Enter your name into \"ColumnName\"\n6.  Save\n\n#### Important Notes\n\n*   This can only be done for \\*new\\* controls on the page, once you save and it generates, you're SOL  \n    \n*   This is as of SF 9.2",
