{"title":"DB Driven Scripting and Styling with SF4","needsFixing":false,"content":"  SF4 has two super cool widgets which I love to use\n\n1.  CSS Widget\n2.  Javascript widget\n\n![Script Style Widget](/images/posts/db-driven-scripting-and-styling-with-sf4/2011_06_04_scripts_styles_widgets.png?sfvrsn\u003d55058b66_2 \"2011_06_04_scripts_styles_widgets\")\n\nNow here\u0027s why they are special...since they\u0027re page widgets and not physical files, they\u0027re subject to VERSIONING!  The only problem is they are honking big and chunky.  There\u0027s no data rendered to the page when they\u0027re drag\\\\dropped or edited.\n\nSo here\u0027s what you do to allow users to place them without gimping up the WYSIWYG design:\n\n*   Edit your masterpage to place a content block below your footer\n\nThe result of this is that the user sees the design, but hanging out below the footer is a content block that\u0027s dedicated to items which don\u0027t factor into the design at all.\n\n It\u0027s a very elegant way to handle custom styling which you can rollback when your editors inevitably screw something up :)\n\nSo here\u0027s what the result looks like...clean, elegant and out of the way. \n\n![Script Style Result](/images/posts/db-driven-scripting-and-styling-with-sf4/2011_06_04_scripts_styles_result.png?sfvrsn\u003d7d058b66_2 \"2011_06_04_scripts_styles_result\")\n\nWhat you can even do is wrap it in a div and style the resulting image to specify that only styles and scripts can go in there, perhaps even go the extra mile and make sure that wrapper has a display:none defined on it so they can\u0027t even physically put content into it.  Now I should mention that the display:none should only be active in LIVE mode :)  You can know you\u0027re on design mode by checking if the body tag has the class \u0027.sfPageEditor\u0027\n\nHappy Sitefinitizing!","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img19.jpg","seoDescription":"Best way to leverage scripts and styles widgets while keeping the design clean","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img19.jpg","publishedAt":"2012-03-16T01:42:03.1700000Z","slug":"db-driven-scripting-and-styling-with-sf4","legacyUrl":"/code/2012/03/16/db-driven-scripting-and-styling-with-sf4","markdown":true,"tags":["Tutorial"]}
