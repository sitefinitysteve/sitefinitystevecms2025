You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be “localtest.test” which could put your confidential information at risk. \n```\n\n/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Herd/config/valet/CA/LaravelValetVASelfSigned.pem\n\nThen in the simulator, go to Settings -> General -> About -> Certificate Trust Settings\n\nIn finder drag and drop the certificate into the simulator and it will be added to the trusted list.\n\nYou might need to back out to settings home, then back in to see it enabled\n\n\n\nN﻿ow in your App_Resources\\iOS\\info.plist add\n\n```\n\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n\n<dict>\n\n<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n\n<true/>\n\n<key>NSExceptionDomains</key>\n\n<dict>\n\n<key>tripclok.test</key>\n\n<dict>\n\n<key>NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>\n\n<true/>\n\n<key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>\n\n<true/>\n\n<key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>\n\n<true/>\n\n</dict>\n\n</dict>\n\n</dict>\n\n```\n\n```\n\nn﻿s clean\n\nn﻿s run ios\n\n```\n\nS﻿hould be good now"
