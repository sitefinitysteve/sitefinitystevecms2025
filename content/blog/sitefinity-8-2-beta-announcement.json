  "content": "So this was quickly posted and yanked, but there's lots of great stuff here that some people might not want to wait to see :)  \n  \nThis version contains Personalization per widget, Froms MVC widgets support, Performance and Upgrade improvements, extended Cloud Support for Azure Websites and more.   \n  \n**Please, take a look and let us know what you think!  \n  \nImportant Note**: Sitefinity 8.2 Beta is not production ready and should not be used on live sites. Upgrades from and to it will not be supported.\n\nWhat’s New\n----------\n\n### Online Marketing\n\n#### Personalization on Widget Level\n([documentation](https://docs.sitefinity.com/82/overview-personalization))  \nWhen editing a page or page template users can personalize on a widget level without having to create a new personalized version of the page or page template. This speeds the creation of personalized areas and eases the management of changes over time.\n\nPersonalizing widgets in page templates empowers users to reuse personalized blocks across numerous pages. Personalization support will be offered for the following widgets: _Content block, Image,_ and Custom widgets.\n\n#### Personalization by Multiple Segments** When a user in multiple segments loads a page, she sees all widgets personalized for those segments, and not only the widgets personalized for the highest priority segment, as it is now. In the backend, users previewing personalized pages can filter by more than one segments to see how the page will display to users in multiple segments.   \n  \n\n### Project Feather\n#### Forms MVC Support ([documentation](https://docs.sitefinity.com/82/forms))  \nUsers can create forms that leverage the look and feel of an MVC website. Developers have full control over the markup of all form elements and caneasily customize and develop new custom forms widgets following Feather conventions.  \n  \nThe following features are included:\n\n*   _Form widget_ on MVC\n*   _Form Builder widgets_ on MVC: Textbox, Multiple choice, Checkboxes, Paragraph text box, Dropdown list, Section header, Instructional text, File upload, Forms Captcha, and Submit button\n*   _Form Builder layout widgets_ as in the Feather resource package\n\n#### Unification of the Grid Widgets  \n\nThe Page toolbox now dispplayes only one set of grid widgets, instead of separate section for the each packages. The templates of the grid widgets are loaded dynamically depending on the package on which is based the page.\n\n(Note: NuGet packages are available on [https://nuget.sitefinity.com](https://nuget.sitefinity.com/). The packages are beta version with number 8.2.5880.0, so you need to switch to \"PreRelease\" version of NuGet Package Manager)\n\n### Cloud Support\n\n#### Deployment to Azure Web Apps**  \n([documentation](https://docs.sitefinity.com/82/deploy-projects-to-azure-web-apps))  \nAdmins can easily deploy Sitefinity projects to Azure Web Apps using Visual Studio or PowerShell scripts.  Redis is used for NLB communication.\n\n### Upgrades\n\n**Data Base Schema Changes Log**   \n([documentation](https://docs.sitefinity.com/82/log-changes-to-the-database-during-upgrades))  \nUpdates to the database schema done during upgrades are logged in the UpgradeTrace.log. This adds visibility into the upgrade process, and provides detailed info, which can be used for troubleshooting.\n\n### Performance\n\nPerformance Optimization Page ([documentation](https://docs.sitefinity.com/82/performance-optimization-page))  \nIn the Backend, a new page provides an overview of common settings that affect website performance. Administrators can use it to view the current state of these settings and the overall degree to which the website has been optimized.  \n\n**SSL Offloading** ([documentation](https://docs.sitefinity.com/82/administration-ssl-offloading))  \nBy using SSL offloading, Administrators can transfer the processing of SSL encryption and decryption from the webserver(s) to the load balancer or other device. It is useful when you have many HTTPS requests.\n\n### Dev Tools and Frameworks\n\n*   UI for [ASP.NET](https://asp.net/) AJAX – upgraded to [Q2 2015 SP2 (v 2015.2.826)](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history/ui-for-asp-net-ajax-q2-2015-sp2-version-2015-2-826)\n*   Kendo UI libraries  - upgraded to [2015 Q2 SP2](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/kendo-ui/release-history/kendo-ui-q2-2015-sp2)\n*   Service Stack – upgraded to v4.0.44\n*   GeoIP database upgraded with latest changes since 09 Sep 2015\n*   [FancyBox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) upgraded to version [v2.1.5](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox/releases/tag/v2.1.5)\n\nWhat’s Fixed\n------------\n\n### Analytics\n\n*   Changing a site domain and not updating Analytics data generates an error in the error log that cause performance issue ([FP](https://feedback.telerik.com/Project/153/Feedback/Details/168869))\n*   Filtering the analytics dashboards by visitors, languages, devices, etc creates an error log ([FP](https://feedback.telerik.com/Project/153/Feedback/Details/168856))\n*   Navigating to Marketing->Analytics after having active analytics connection generates error log ([FP](https://feedback.telerik.com/Project/153/Feedback/Details/168854))\n\n### Core\n\n*   Changing library root URL causes sitemap problems.
