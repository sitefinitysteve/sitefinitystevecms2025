[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ELMAHErrorLoggingModulesAndHandlersForASPNETAndMVCToo.aspx)\n2.  [Detailed Setup Document](https://dotnetslackers.com/articles/aspnet/ErrorLoggingModulesAndHandlers.aspx)\n\n It\u0027s an HttpModule which intercepts all crashes and logs them to a single table in your database, then provides a nice simple interface (and rss feed) to see the log items.\n\n#### STEP 1\nWeb.Config Updates\n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/473d2f5fb2b31b8848af8e7c210422e5.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n#### STEP 2\nSQL Script to create the table (included in the download file in the db folder)\n\n#### STEP 3\nCopy the Assemblies to your bin folder (ignore the SqlLite and VistaDB dlls)\n\nNow you can visit [https://www.yoursite.com/Sitefinity/elmah.axd](https://www.yoursite.com/Sitefinity/elmah.axd), log in, and hopefully see no errors ;)",
