It\u0027s an input\\[type\u003dtext\\] with a ton of validation and stuff, but we KNOW who the user is. \n\nSo the modification below checks to see if the user is authenticated, if they are, it\u0027s just a hidden field and no extra bloat.  You could though keep this file the same and just name a NEW template like Write.Authenticated.cshtml and pick that in the form control designer.\n\nThis is my modification to the default template.\n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/b9f2629dae499fc3709890469c5e1486.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### Installation\n\nAdd this to ~/Mvc/Views/EmailTextField/Write.Default.cshtml",
