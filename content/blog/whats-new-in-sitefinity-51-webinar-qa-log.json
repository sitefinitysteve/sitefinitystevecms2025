    "content": "This is the unedited QA session log for the 5.1 webinar  \n  \nThanks all :)  \n  \n\n* * *\n\n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: When can we expect to find some \"how-to\"\u0027s for developing widgets o templates in MVC?  \nA: many guides are already on our youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/TelerikSitefinityCMS) more are coming soon here and to our documentation getting started guide.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: I\u0027ve struggled with styling and confining width of the blog posts widget in email campaigns.  Does 5.1 offer any relief here?  \nA: We have imporved the e-mail campaigns design process. You can now include your own CSS files and design it as if you are designing pages. It then is automatically translated to inline styles.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: So any webforms pages we\u0027ve already created will still work, alongside future MVC pages?  \nA: Yes  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: When can we expect to find some \"how-to\"\u0027s for developing widgets o templates in MVC?  \nA: You can check the complete MVC documentation here: https://www.sitefinity.com/documentation/documentationarticles/developers-guide/sitefinity-essentials/how-does-sitefinity-use-asp.net-mvc/creating-custom-models-controllers-and-views. More videos and getting started guides are in the pipeline  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: The email message template offers no CSS widget.  How would you attach a stylesheet to the email template?  \nA: Create a page template. Attach the CSS there. Create a campaign based on this template.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: should I be able to hear something?  \nA: Now yes.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Hello?  \nA: Hi.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Does Search work on Azure yet?  \nA: The sitefinity search yes, but it\u0027s not based on Azure search yet  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: If you choose a template to be hybrid, is that webforms by default and mvc gets translated, or is mvc default and webforms will be translated?  \nA: Both are default :)  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: I\u0027ve struggled with styling and confining width of the blog posts widget in email campaigns.  Does 5.1 offer any relief here?  \nA: probably yes, but we\u0027d recommend get in touch with the support staff, they will be able to help  \n**  \nAudience Question**  \nQ: so if i choose hybrid and have an mvc type \u0027masterpage\u0027 when I drop in a webforms widget, the msajax/scriptmanager will automatically get added - but if its just an mvc widget it\u0027ll be totally clean?  \nA: yes.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: So 5.1 can work with a mixed php / .net development?  \nA: No, just .NET (for now ;) )  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: So any webforms pages we\u0027ve already created will still work, alongside future MVC pages?  \nA: Yes.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: I think there are no inline styling options in the blog posts widget.  \nA: we have an engine now to convert all styles to inline ones. This is new in 5.1.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: So 5.1 can work with a mixed php / .net development? I ask because our company is pushing to move to another CMS due to the huge amount of Sitefinity generated code on the .net platform and it seems that websites running on php appear cleaner on the background source code and get ranked higher in Google.  \nA: That\u0027s why we introduce Razor templates and MVC support.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Will Sitefinity Thunder be updated to create widgets in MVC?  \nA: Yes. soon.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: will you provide standard tests that can be used with TestStudio ?  \nA: No plans for this for now.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Will Sitefinity Thunder work on Azure soon?  Currently it appears to not work with Azure hosted sites.  \nA: We are working in this direction. Definitely a must.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Any progress on supporting compilation tranfsforms natively in the .config files (I.e. debug vs release)?  \nA: We haven\u0027t done anything on this yet.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Does your MVC implementation support more complex scenarios like custom validation and custom ViewModels?  \nA: Absolutely.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: how to upgrade my published ver 5.0 to 5.1  \nA: We have upgrade instructions posted on the web site, but you should do the upgrade locally first, then publish the upgraded version back to the web.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: For the page template, if we chose WebForms, would it be easy to change to hybrid later on?  \nA: Yes, just edit the template and change the mode.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Does a local upgrade, if tied to an Azure SQL db via the connection string, upgrade Azure SQL?  \nA: We\u0027d recommend doing the whole upgrade procedure locally to avoid permissions problems. Later on you can deploy the whole package to Azure.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: when will the modulebuilder output mvc ?  \nA: This hasn\u0027t been planned yet.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: can the radcontrols:mvc tools be plugged in, just like radcontrols:ajax are now?  \nA: Yes they can.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: perhpas a Hello World with MVC and one with regular Web Forms?  \nA: Currently demoed :)  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Will we see something more complex than Hello World?  \nA: The SDK will be released with a more complex application showcasing CRUD.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: That is, the styles were ignored.  \nA: that\u0027s not the case in the new version :-)  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: okay all those WebResource.axd references, how can we minimize how many of those there are? that is one of the reasons our complany wants to move to a cleaner solution like php....I am trying to find a solution here though in Sitefinity before we go that route.....  \nA: This is the case in WebForms mode. When switched to Razor and MVC, you\u0027ll not see such resources.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: will you show something about the new features of the module builder?  \nA: Yes, by the end of the Webinar, we will show some of the new features in the Module Builder.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Is this using MVC 3 or MVC 4?  \nA: MVC 3. We are looking forward in supporting MVC 4 as well, when it is released officially.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: What is your input on something that you promise to deliver but you do not : \"KendoUI will be utilized more in the Sitefinity backend - this will allow less JavaScript to be served to the user\u0027s browser, resulting in backend load times as much as twice as fast, allowing you to create and edit content items at an amazing speed.\"  \nA: It is utilized more - in the field controls in the module builder, the entire Ecampaigns module and the UI for administering modules install/uninstall. We are continuing with this trend (of using KendoUI more) with the next releases.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: do modules built with the module builder have multilingual capabilities?  \nA: Not at the moment.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Guys, we\u0027ve just uploaded Thunder with the MVC features that Gabe is showing  \nA: Fast we are! :)  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: will the layout tab (dropping regions) change with v5.2 when kendo/mvc widgets will be more introduced?  \nA: We cannot commit to a timeframe for this, unfortunately.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: but you can have a module with different fields for the different languages and set permissions by field  \nA: That is true.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Q: Will converting forms to MVC improve performance/load time for pages?  \nA: Yes.  \n**  \nAudience Question**  \nQ: When will Sitefinity completely get rid of its dependency on Silverlight?  I was under the impression that Sitefinity v. 5.1 was completely rewritten using Kendo UI?  \nA: We are going to replace the File Uploader first. We\u0027ll do it as soon as possible, but can\u0027t commit to certain timeframe yet.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Which pieces in the administrative back end were actually re-written using Kendo UI?  Almost every action still seems to use Silverlight.  \nA: The only places we use SL is in the Images upload and Analytics module.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: I have a question about custom registration profile. after the user is create i give him a new role but he cannot see the page. he must do a logout for that. here also a other example in the sitefinity forum: https://www.sitefinity.com/devnet/forums/sitefinity/developing-with-sitefinity/assigning-a-user-to-a-role.aspx Can you help me?  \nA: Could you please open a support case for that?  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Are there benchmark results comparing Sitefinity v. 5.1 performance v. 3.7?  \nA: 5.0 vs 5.1.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Does 5.1  support active directory federated services as a membership provider built in? adfs  \nA: No, we don\u0027t support this yet.  \n**  \nAudience Question**  \nQ: can you please drop the music store which provides a free ecom basis and promote the built in sf ecom more that you sell for $2000  \nA: That\u0027s just a demo :)  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Have any new SEO features been added or expanded on?  \nA: We haven\u0027t done this for 5.1.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Is there a plan for this in the future and if so is there a timeframe for when?  \nA: It really depends on the requirements. Would you care to share what kind of SEO features you are looking for? If yes - georgi.chokov@telerik.com Thanks in advance!  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Will SF 5.1 support asp.net 4.5 and visual studio 2012 as soon as they are released released? Or, will SF 5.2 be the new version at the time?  \nA: We will support Visual Studio 2012 when the official release is out, but will probably need some time before conversion to .net.4.5  \n**  \nAudience Question**  \nQ: The Google Analytics Module has been a bit difficult to configure for myself and a few other Sitefinity users I connected with in 5.0, has this become more intuitive in 5.1?  \nA: No changes in this area yet...  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: To Telerik private: Reading some of the questions and \"comments\" amazing how patient you guys are with some obnoxious and rude people :)  \nA: I am happy to all kinds of feedback :) All questions can be a \u0027feedback\u0027 if you look at that side of the things..  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: So, we should\u0027t upgrade the Web server to asp.net 4.5 until we hear from you (Telerik).  \nA: We haven\u0027t tested yet, that\u0027s why we cannot commit :)  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: can we view the source on that?  \nA: We\u0027ll try to provide it.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Can you also extend documents / images with new fields?  \nA: Yes, this is possible.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: when extending the existing SF modules with custom fields, do they work with multilingual translations?  \nA: Yes.  \n  \nAudience Question  \nQ: will we be able to download this webinar afterward?  \nA: Yes.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: when extending the existing SF modules with custom fields, do they work with multilingual translations?  \nA: Actually no, sorry for the confision.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Can the custom module types relations be nested, i.e. customers -\u003e invoices -\u003e line items etc. ?  \nA: Yes.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: What level of SF do I need to have access to Module Builder? Is Standard enough?  \nA: Yes. All editions have it.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Does 5.1 handle custom role providers based on asp.net roleprovider?  \nA: Yes.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: does the online documentation include the the module builder updates, specifically the content relationships stuff?  \nA: Yes.

Most companies use an email provider.  \nA: You can e-mail from Gmail if you want to.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Do you plan on releasing some tools for exporting/importing content data in 5.x projects?  \nA: This is supported in the Module Builder. Sounds as a great idea to have it across all modules.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: Have ther been any advances in mobile email client formatting?  \nA: Not yet, but we are researching on the best approaches here.  \n  \n**Audience Question**  \nQ: will MVP\u0027s get access to ux.sitefinity.com ?  \nA: No. This is internal resource only.
