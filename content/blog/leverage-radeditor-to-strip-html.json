  "content": "The RadEditor does a pretty badass job of stripping HTML since you can feed the html string into the .Content property, and then just read it back out via the Text property.  Here's a quick extension method which does just that\n\n<div class='embeddedscript' data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/ac9ba56ec982688efd5c6041e4309d72.js?file=striphtml.cs\"></div>\n\n Ok so now this makes the StripHtml method available right on the object instead of needing to pass in a value and return something back.  Just like .ToString(), you'll now do .StripHtml()\n\n<div class='embeddedscript' data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/ac9ba56ec982688efd5c6041e4309d72.js?file=inaction.cs\"></div>\n\n### Alternatives\n\nIf you HAVE the RadEditor in the project, might as well use it if you want to keep the project as light as possible.  But going forward really the *BEST* bet is the [HtmlAgilityPack](https://html-agility-pack.net/)",
