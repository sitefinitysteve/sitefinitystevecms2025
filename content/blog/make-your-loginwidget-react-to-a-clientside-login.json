{"title":"Make your LoginWidget react to a clientside login","needsFixing":false,"content":"Personally I miss the old click, postback, login of Sitefinity Forms Auth.  The problem with the client Auth is if there\u0027s \"lag\" waiting for the server to respond...user sees zero feedback in the native widget.  However, the clientside ajax claims method lets us do some neat things where we don\u0027t need to modify teleriks code :)  \n  \njQuery has a few global methods you can hook into that will let you know when an ajax call is taking place.  So on a page like a dedicated login where the ONLY ajax would be the LoginWidget this works great!  \n  \nThis code assumes you\u0027ve cached your jQuery selector to $loginPage.loginWidget.  Feel free to modify as you need.  You SHOULD cache it, just...you know...remember it\u0027s a jquery object in this case.  \n  \n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/8f8c810a191ca45c75dc13e27286840b.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n  \nAlso please note...the classes I\u0027m adding are to hide and show messages...you could just as easily change the message text with jquery directly in this script.  \n  \nThis code also has a \"long\" mode where if for some reason the login is just godawful slow, the user won\u0027t worry that it\u0027s frozen.  I like to hide or disable the login button when it\u0027s \"authenticating\" so they can\u0027t click it again.  \n  \nSteve","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img12.jpg","seoDescription":"Fancify your Sitefinity login with some ajax hooks","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img12.jpg","publishedAt":"2013-11-27T19:09:05.1370000Z","slug":"make-your-loginwidget-react-to-a-clientside-login","legacyUrl":"/code/2013/11/27/make-your-loginwidget-react-to-a-clientside-login","markdown":true,"tags":[]}
