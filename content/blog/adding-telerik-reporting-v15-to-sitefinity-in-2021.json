  "seoDescription": "Telerik Reporting was removed from Sitefinity, if you need printable PDF business reports, here's how you can easily get them back.",
  "content": "So jump in the way back machine, Sitefinity v4 shipped with a (really bad\\buggy) eComm module. However part of that module was reporting using the [Telerik.Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx) assemblies.  Sometime around v12 or 13 they decomissioned the old eComm module (in favour of [uCommerce](https://ucommerce.net/)), and subsequently stopped shipping the Telerik.Reporting DLLs with Sitefinity.\n\nWell, I had to do some more reporting UIs, so we re-licensed the product so we could get the latest v15 assemblies and (more importantly) get access to the Visual Studio 2022 reporting designer. It's not REQUIRED to generate a report, you can do it all through code, but it does simplify it quite substantially.\n\nSo the most important part is to follow the [installation doc](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/telerik-reporting-rest-host-http-service-using-web-hosting) the provide, *but* when you come to the part about registering routes **IGNORE IT!** It'll tell you to just call this\n\n```\nReportsControllerConfiguration.RegisterRoutes(GlobalConfiguration.Configuration);\n```\nHowever when Sitefinity tries to load it'll crash right away because some of the default route names conflict with Sitefinity. What we have to do instead is manually register them, and here it is!  Just call this in Global.asax INSTEAD if the ReportsControllerConfiguration.RegisterRoutes that they provide.\n\n<div class=\"embeddedscript\" data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/59f123a85c1a668a415fc982c4cea464.js?file=RegisterReportingRoutes.cs\"></div>\n\nSo for the viewer part, here's the [setup doc](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/html5-mvc-report-viewer-embedding) but I'll also post my Vue implementation here (still uses some jQuery, viewer requires it...). Feel free to use or not, and\\or tweak. It is a shareable vue component I use inside other REPORTNAME.cshtml files like this\n\n```\n<telerik-report-viewer ref=\"viewer\" v-if=\"renderReport\" :params=\"params\"></telerik-report-viewer>\n``` \n\n<div class=\"embeddedscript\" data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/59f123a85c1a668a415fc982c4cea464.js?file=reportviewer-vue.component.js\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"embeddedscript\" data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/59f123a85c1a668a415fc982c4cea464.js?file=ReportViewer.cshtml\"></div>\n"
