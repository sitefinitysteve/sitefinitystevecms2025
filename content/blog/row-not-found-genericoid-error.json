{"title":"Row not found: GenericOID Error","needsFixing":false,"content":"The Row not found: GenericOID error pops up in the forums every once and a while, so I thought I\u0027d blog a bit on a potential fix for it.\n\nThe problem comes from the OpenAccess level 2 cache which of course is the cause of and solution to...all of life\u0027s problems :)\n\nIts purpose is to sit as a layer in memory between your app (IIS in this case) and the database.  So the obvious benefit is faster results since the object you want is cached in memory and no call needs to happen back to the database.  So if you have multiple users with multiple active OA Context objects, they\u0027d all be just pinging back to that sweet sweet cache layer and not hammering your DB over and over again...which clearly is why it\u0027s enabled in SF (and all of my non-SF sites).\n\nDon\u0027t get worried though, OA is smart enough to refresh the objects when you call certain methods which change the object, like .SaveChanges().  However if you manually change some data directly in the DB, I\u0027ve found that unless there\u0027s an explicit cache evict in the code somewhere you\u0027d need to restart the app pool to get that change reflected.\n\nSo the cache seems to be a bit funkified right now I\u0027m guessing with in a webservice context.  Perhaps what might be happening is that there\u0027s multiple contexts going on and one knows about a new object where another doesn\u0027t (me guessing on that).\n\nLong boring story short, disabling the OA L2 Cache should resolve this error...and it\u0027s a quick fix.\n\nOpen your Data.Config file, and just add the following\n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/bfc5bd0cf9e8602813c8c115a4a671b8.js\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThis also should lower memory consumption, but again...should probably slightly imapct performance as you;re hitting the DB way more often.\n\nThis is just a quick stop-gap measure until it can be 100% resolved in a future release, so please don\u0027t see this as a shortcoming in either product...I can tell you from experience that OpenAccess is an awesome ORM, and we all know how much I love SF :)\n\nThanks to [Dr. Georgi Chokov](https://twitter.com/georgichokov) for this solution!\n\n### EDIT\nIt should be noted if you\u0027re having issues with the events module NOT saving content items, disabling the L2 will help that as well.  Symptoms would be you open an event, make a change, publish, and it appears as if nothing happened.","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img22.jpg","seoDescription":"Disabling the L2 Cache to fix the Row not found: GenericOID Errors, and Events not saving in Sitefinity","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img22.jpg","publishedAt":"2012-03-16T02:47:56.4170000Z","slug":"row-not-found-genericoid-error","legacyUrl":"/code/2012/03/16/row-not-found-genericoid-error","markdown":true,"tags":["Tutorial"]}
