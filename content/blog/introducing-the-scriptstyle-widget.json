{"title":"Introducing the ScriptStyle Widget","needsFixing":false,"content":"ATTENTION DEVELOPERS\n--------------------\n\nStop using JavaScriptEmbed\\\\CssEmbed widgets IMMEDIATELY...boy are you in for a treat.  \n  \n**Check this out:**  \n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/ed82b8ddf988aa9818d78b56bdb657d2.js?file\u003dDemo1.aspx\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n  \nKeep in mind this assumes the control has been registered with an \"sf prefix\", either at the top of the page or in the webconfig.  \n  \n**Examples (either\\\\or):  \n**Webconfig:  \n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/ed82b8ddf988aa9818d78b56bdb657d2.js?file\u003dweb.config\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n  \nPage\\\\Widget:  \n\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\u0027embeddedscript\u0027 data-src\u003d\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/ed82b8ddf988aa9818d78b56bdb657d2.js?file\u003dTestPage.aspx\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n### What\u0027s it all about\n\nSo you get one simple to use control which will handle both scripts and styles.  The bonus is that the scripts will automatically render at the bottom of the page, and styles will render in the header.  However you can feed the control a property to change the position of the script.  \n\n```\n\u003csf:ScriptStyle runat\u003d\"server\" ScriptEmbedPosition\u003d\"InPlace\"\n```\n\n*   Head\n*   InPlace\n*   BeforeBodyEndTag _(default)_  \n    \n\nThis is one thing the Sitefinity controls can\u0027t do...inline scripting\\\\styling.  You need to hard-link to a physical file in the markup.  LIMITATION, REMOVED!  \n\n### Features\n\n*   Inline code in the markup\n*   Duplicate script detection: Will only load scripts **_once_**.  If you have 5 ScriptStyle widgets all loading the same script, it\u0027ll only appear on the page once.  (Keeping in mind...it\u0027s not searching the page for what scripts are there, it\u0027s just checking other instances itself).  So if you manually have a script linked on the masterpage, then you link it again in this widget...it\u0027ll appear twice.\n*   Visual Studio\\\\Editors will syntax highlight the inline code\n*   Ability to render in multiple places on the page\n*   Automatic detection and wrapping of the \u003cscript and \u003cstyle nodes\n*   You can set an alias that will render in design mode so you can denote what the code you\u0027ve written will do.  Currently NOTHING renders in the existing widgets so you have to keep opening them to figure out what they do.\n*   Define if you want the script to run in design mode or not\n*   You won\u0027t get caught hard-coding the domain prefix on your links...this is a bug in SF that nobody just ever seems to want to take the 30 seconds to fix.\n*   Doesn\u0027t render an empty \u003cspan\u003e\\\\\u003cdiv\u003e on your page where you dropped the widget\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n_(from 6.0.4200.0 to 6.0.4200.1)_  \n\n*   JavaScriptTemplate and CssTemplate nodes have been renamed to \"script\" and \"style\" respectively...easier to remember, and editors like Visual Studio give syntax highlighting automatically.\n\n### Finally\n\n@Telerik I\u0027ll be happy to give you this control to tweak and put into the SF core (and remove it from my assembly)...it\u0027s better than yours :)  \n  \n[Go download the latest version now](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RandomSiteControlsMVC/)","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img9.jpg","seoDescription":"Introduction to the best Script control to use in Sitefinity","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img9.jpg","publishedAt":"2013-05-30T17:36:48.8200000Z","slug":"introducing-the-scriptstyle-widget","legacyUrl":"/code/2013/05/30/introducing-the-scriptstyle-widget","markdown":true,"tags":[]}
