{"title":"Help! My PageEditor is broken!","needsFixing":false,"content":"### Background\n\nThe Sitefinity page editor is not in an iframe, your page markup from your template (basically everything under \u003cbody\u003e) is wrapped in a few helpers that let Sitefinity inject the toolbar and it\u0027s publishing headers.  So this can cause some issues with your styling, PLEASE for the sake of your users fix this for them so it doesn\u0027t look sloppy.  What\u0027s great about it not being in an iFrame though is you can almost literally control everything you see in CSS.  \n  \nHere\u0027s a great example:  \n[![busted-page-editor](/images/posts/help-my-pageeditor-is-broken/busted-page-editor.png?sfvrsn\u003de3358b66_0 \"busted-page-editor\")](/images/posts/help-my-pageeditor-is-broken/busted-page-editor.png?sfvrsn\u003de3358b66_0)So there are a few things to check\n\n### Script errors\n\nIt\u0027s easy to identify a script error as the culprit as usually there will not be any buttons on the top toolbar, OR the buttons do nothing.  Just open your browsers javascript console and look for script errors and resolve.  Maybe its just as simple as commenting out an included JS file in Design mode?  \n\n### Make sure your markup is valid\n\nBy this I mean the markup in your default.cshtml or whatever your main template is.  If there\u0027s a starting div without and end that can break things. Or if there\u0027s maybe an element that should be closed (\u003e, /\u003e) but isn\u0027t the browser can try to \"fix\" it and throw things off\n\n### Make sure you don\u0027t have any \u003cform\u003e tags in your template\n\nThe page editor uses old-scholl WebForms which wraps the ENTIRE page in a \u003cform\u003e tag so the nested tags can be problematic.\n\n### Hunt down conflicting styles\n\nRight-click somewhere on the page, click Inspect, then in the browser dev tools just start looking around and trying to find any conflicting styles.  Maybe you shouldn\u0027t be doing position: absolute somewhere, or maybe it\u0027s an overflow rule, or even a box-sizing.  If 1\u00262 are fine then this is usually the reason.  \n  \nThe good news is Sitefinity puts \"sfPageEditor\" as a class onto the body tag so you can override the styling as needed in the page editor.  Maybe you need to hide a problematic element?  \n\n```\n.sfPageEditor .nav .mySearchBar{\n   display: none;\n}\n```\n  \nReally you can do anything once you know .sfPageEditor is there.  There\u0027s even an extra class to let you know which editor you are on.  \nWidget mode: body class\u003d\"sfPageEditor zeContentMode\"  \nLayout mode: body class\u003d\"sfPageEditor zeLayoutMode\"  \n  \nSo to re-iterate for the sake of your users editing experience PLEASE try to add a few of these rules to improve their editing experience.  Usually it only takes one or 2, but it can make the difference between a happy client or a frustrated client.","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img22.jpg","seoDescription":"Identifying problems in the Sitefinity page editor","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img22.jpg","publishedAt":"2017-08-25T15:59:40.1370000Z","slug":"help-my-pageeditor-is-broken","legacyUrl":"/code/2017/08/25/help-my-pageeditor-is-broken","markdown":true,"tags":["Tutorial"]}
