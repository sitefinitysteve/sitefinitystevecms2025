I think at some point the syntax changed, so I spent quite a while trying to sort it out, now you don't need to! \n\nStackoverflow is full of I guess old articles saying the facebook uri is like this:\n\n```\nfb://profile/username or fb://page/username.Â  \n```\n\nBut it doesn't work, just loads the facebook app to the default your profile view.  \n  \nI guess as of a certain version it is required to load into a special child view or something, anyway, this is the code that works.  \n  \nWas super straight forward on iOS\n\n```\nfb://profile?id=username\n```\n  \nThis was tested by me using Nativescript 6.5 Typescript, however this isn't Nativescript specific.",
