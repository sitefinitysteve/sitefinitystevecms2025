{"title":"Positioning in Sitefinity 4","needsFixing":false,"content":"So what we always used to do in Sitefinity 3 for positioning was a couple things right...you use the RadEditor to set alignment, or you create a new template. The problems with that are numerours, and end up frustrating the clients who want to do it all themselves without needing to put out more cash.\n\n So enter Sitefinity 4 layout controls.  We can now let the user dynamically create literally almost any layout they want in seconds.  HOWEVER the concept shouldn\u0027t stop there.\n\nThe Image or Document widgets are a great example of what I mean.  You can drop them into the right side of a 50-50 layout control and what happens...they hug the left edge of the layout control.  But hey, you want it to be right-aligned!...you can do that in the RadEditor when you insert an image right?\n\nSo the way to do this is to drop a **second** layout control into the right side of that 50-50 and then use the resize controls to just skootch it over to where you want it.\n\nSo yes, this does add a bit more markup (nests in about 3 more divs)...but it\u0027s a codeless solution which really isn\u0027t THAT heavy :)\n\nSo here\u0027s another example...my contact form uses inputs which scale to 100% of their container, but I don\u0027t want the form to be that long.  So just plop in a layout control and leave one of the sides empty.  \n\n![Positioning](/images/posts/positioning-in-sitefinity-4/2011_09_05_positioning.jpg?sfvrsn\u003d54058b66_2 \"2011_09_05_Positioning\")","featuredImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img17.jpg","seoDescription":"How to use no code to keep things properly sized in sitefinity 4","seoMetaImage":"/images/stock/500x280/img17.jpg","publishedAt":"2012-03-16T01:26:31.2870000Z","slug":"positioning-in-sitefinity-4","legacyUrl":"/code/2012/03/16/positioning-in-sitefinity-4","markdown":true,"tags":["Tutorial"]}
