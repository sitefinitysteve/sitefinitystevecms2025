Lets say you have a small 150x150 header logo, but your developer saved it as 1000x1000 and it's just being shrunk to 150 in the browser.  That's a whole lot of wasted Kb the browser has to download. In a nutshell, just size them properly and send the actual images through a [lossless compressor](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+image+compressor)\n\nIf you use icons anywhere they should be [sprited](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/css-sprites.php) so it's a single image downloaded. \n\nYour logo should ideally be part of that sprite or an SVG.  SVG is optimal because it's quality infinitely scales.\n\nTools like Google's [Page Speed Insights] (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) should be able to tell you when you have bad images on your page.\n",
