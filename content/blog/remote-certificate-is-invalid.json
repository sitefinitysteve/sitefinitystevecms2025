Lets assume we're wanting to secure our new \"dev.mysite.com\" setup in IIS.  \n  \n* Open Powershell as Administrator (right-click on it)  \n* Run this to get a self signed long expiry cert \n\n<div class='embeddedscript' data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/a8cdd04fb1b4a49952819d5d2d71ccba.js\"></div>\n    \n* Open the \"Manage computer certificates\" window (through start\\\\programs, cortana search, whatever)\n    \n* Your cert should be under Personal->Certificates, click on it, find your cert\n    \n* Right-click->All Tasks->Manage Private Keys\n    \n* Give your sites App pool access (Example: iis apppool\\\\dev.mysite.com), save up\n    \n* Right-click the cert and Copy\n    \n* Now expand Trusted Root Certification Authorities->Certificates\n    \n* Paste your cert into here\n    \n* Now open your Sitefinity AuthenticationConfig.config, and put this into it  \n    \n<div class='embeddedscript' data-src=\"https://gist.github.com/sitefinitysteve/e4436a102ad711e73965f8e25b1a9fce.js\"></div>\n    \n* Don't forget to edit your IIS bindings to use this new https certificate\n    \n*   1.  Open IIS \n    2.  Click your site\n    3.  Click Bindings\n    4.  If https is not here click Add (or if it is, select and hit edit)\n    5.  Fill in the details, choose the new dev.mysite.com cert in the bottom SSL dropdown.\n\n* REQUIRED FOR MACOS\\Parallels\n\nhttps://iboysoft.com/news/how-to-trust-a-certificate-on-mac.html\n\nI﻿f you don't do step 13, then the host browser will show insecure cert errors, even if windows is configured to trust.",
