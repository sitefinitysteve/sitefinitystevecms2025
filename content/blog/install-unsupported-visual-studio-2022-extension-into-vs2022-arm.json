  "content": "There's so many Extensions in the Visual Studio marketplace, but very few have been updated for ARM, which is incredibly frustrating as most will *just work* right out of the box.\n\nY﻿ou'll click on it and get a \"This extension is not installable on any currently installed products\" error.\n\nI﻿ can't guarantee ALL will work perfectly, but here's how to get them to work\n\n* Download the VSIX\n\n* Run, if it works, you're done!  If not... continue\n\n* Install 7Zip\n\n* Open the VSIX in 7Zip\n\n* Open the \"extension.vsixmanifest\" file\n\n* Look for the ProductArchitecture node with \"amd64\"\n\n* Change it to \"arm64\"\n\n* Save it back to the vsix\n\n.﻿..now install fine"
