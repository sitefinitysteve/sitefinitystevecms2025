Just PAINFUL when you realize you left something dumb in the code that will require another Build action.  \n  \n  So someone over there noticed this (I\u0027d post the name but g+ is being a turd and not letting me get to comment history that far back, sorry....Nikolay?), and PRE-compiled all the templates into a single assembly (I think around 800 of them)....so what do we have now if you repeat the steps above?  For me on that same machine 10-15 seconds before the site is responsive again, and any subsequent clicks are INSTANT :)  No more needing to pre-load anything...TAKE THAT ASP.NET.  \n  \n![Ron burgundy](/images/posts/sitefinity-54-this-is-the-release-youve-been-waiting-for/ron-burgundy-glass-case-of-emotion.jpg?sfvrsn\u003df1c8b66_2 \"ron burgundy glass case of emotion\")  \n  \n[So go, download, and enjoy](https://www.telerik.com/account/your-products/download-list.aspx?skucid\u003d21)  \n  \n\\* I might have made that up",
